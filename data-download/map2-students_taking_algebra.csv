"Notes: This table is based on data submitted by 50 states and the District of Columbia. It only includes school districts that are regular local school districts (including local school districts that are component of a supervisory union) based on the Common Core of Data (CCD) and with at least one school serving grade 8 students based on the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) data. Total number of grade 8 students was from the CCD; therefore, schools that were not found in CCD or whose grade 8 Algebra I enrollment (as reported in CRDC) was lower than their grade 8 total enrollment (as reported in CCD) were excluded from this analysis.
